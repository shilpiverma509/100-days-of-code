### Day 11&12: June 25&26 , 2017 

**Today's Progress**:Day 11&12: Finished the  Responsive web design course on udemy @jonasschmedtman .

### Day 13&14: June 27&28 , 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Finished the first three  chapeters of You Don't Know JS: this & Object Prototypes: 

**Thoughts:** Learned about Objects in detail. How to use "this" keyword. Lernt about  the rules of default,explicit, hard and Implicit Bindings for "this".
Learnt about "new" and its rules.

New : If we put new keyword in front of a function call, it creates a brand new constructor of that function call. The following 4 things happen when we use new :


	1. A brand new object is created.
	2. *This object gets linked to a different object.
	3. Brand new object gets bound to this keyword for that function call.
	4. If that function doesnt otherwise return anything , it will implicitly insert  a return this. (so that brand new object will be returned for that call


 Determine the Order Of Precedence

	1. Was the function called with "new"? If yes, use that object.
	2. If not, was the function called with "call" or "apply" specifying an explicit this?-If yes use that object.
	3. Was the function called via a containing/owning object (context)-if so, use that object.
	4. DEFAULT: global object(except strict mode).


Note :New keyword is  able to override hard binding
